## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

  Code documentation is a written explanation of what each part of your code does, and how it does it. You can document your code in a read-me, some other form of an attached readable file, or you can leave documentation in the code itself with comments.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

  The future you might not remember how the code you are writing now works, or even what it does. Let alone if other people are trying to use/edit/work-on what your previous work. It makes your code useable for the future you and other people. It can also help you better understand the code you have wrote, and even catch errors or make improvements.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

  Code documentation is extremely important because it improves the usability of what you have written. Unless you don't want to be able to reuse your code easily in the future and you don't want others to use it, there are no real benefits of not documenting your code short of saving a tiny bit of time. And if you have already spend lots of time writing the code, why not just write down what you are doing and how it works so all the effort you have put in isn't just voided in the future.

  Making sure the words you put into your back-end code for the url endpoints is very important and can easily be overlooked if you are single-mindedly focused on the relationships between your Js Nodes. Then some parts of functions will not function and throw very weird errors that can be quite hard to find the source of.
