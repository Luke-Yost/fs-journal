## Questions 

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

  Pair programming is just two people writing code together. One person is typing out the code called the driver, and the other is watching/helping think stuff through. They should both be talking out loud and cohesively writing out code. They should be switching every few minutes or so.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

  You have a second pair of eyes watching your spelling, you have a person to bounce your thoughts off of, and a direct reason to talk out all of the code you are writing.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

  If people aren't collaborating effectively it can be a waste of resources. It also requires both people to get along and be comfortable being in close proximity to one another.

Depending on how confidant and knowledgeable on the content of the code you are writing, it might just be more efficient and significantly less draining to just work together on one part instead of trying to work separately.
