## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

  Caleb and I did the majority of our work together after the first nights reading and although we didn't get more done than if we worked individually, we finished a similar volume of work and it was much less mentally draining. The code was also a bit better plus I definitely was able to learn more and retain what we had gone over.

2. What went well this week?

  I was able to get the checkpoint completed to a passing standard during lunch on monday, so during lab i was able to start working with Caleb right away and not be behind at all. It was also really nice to be able to review content instead of just trying to cram more info in. I felt like I had started to forget some of the things about node js back-end stuff and other random snippets of info. Now not learning much new material enables me to better solidify the previous knowledge and better prepare for the upcoming checkpoints and projects.

3. What would you do differently?
