## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Having a massive partial pyramid of brackets at the end of a function can be a sign of 'callback hell' and it is caused by trying to order functions so that they hoist in the correct order to run the code properly without any pauses.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous is having you program continue to run while some sections of the code wait for return values. The code that is stored to run after the values are returned are called callbacks.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

By following 3 simple run that go along with creating well written code. They are keeping your code shallow, divide up your code into modules, and by handling every single error in your code.
