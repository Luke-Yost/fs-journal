## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

You used to have to use many different script tags from different libraries to import all the different code you wanted but now you can just link the html document to main.js and have main.js be the link to all the other js files.

2. How does export differ from export default?

They only seem to differ in syntax of how code is imported and exported.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code can be split into smaller files making it easier to debug, among many other benefits.
