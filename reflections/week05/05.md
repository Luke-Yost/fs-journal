  This week went pretty well. Even with me starting out a bit behind with not having my checkpoint passing, I got all 14 of the checks done on the second evaluation. I started out the week a bit lost but I just kept working at the content and by wednesday it really started to make sense. It was quite a relief to realize that the hack-a-thon was this friday, and that we didn't have a individual checkpoint. Working with a group and having a decent bit of time to work was great and having another person being able to look at my code saved me tons of time on little errors and I did the same for my teammates. It was also really nice not to have to worry about the checkpoint over the weekend and just be able to watch the vue videos, decompress, and catch up on sleep. Overall I really enjoyed this week.
