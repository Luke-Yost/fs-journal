## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

The three types are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

  The benefits of linking are that there are a virtually unlimited amount of data that can be attached to the original node and it does not increase the amount of data that the object that the many are linked to. It is also much easier to get parts of all the linked data and not be forced to retrieve all of it.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

  You need to try and plan out how data will be added changed or deleted, and how that will change the relationships in your data structure. Many outside factors will influence this.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

  The syntax was making sense for what each thing was doing, and how it mimicked the front-end MVC in most ways. I was still pretty confused overall on exactly what the sum of the stuff I was coding was doing but thankfully I got a good nights sleep and got it all figured out by wednesday.
