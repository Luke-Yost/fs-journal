## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

  Timeboxing is just planning out how much time tasks will take and then limiting the time you are able to work on it to the original amount when you planned it. Not just working until you get it done.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

  Three important ones for me are strategically quitting, better prioritizing my work, and the 2 minute rule. I need to just follow the timers I set and when they go off, just quit no matter how close to finishing whatever the current task. Lots of the time I also just create a list of tasks in my head that are just ordered by when I think of them, not by their importance. Then I just kinda follow the order that they are in my head for no real reason. I have been writing down all my daily tasks in a journal and using different colors of pens to order their importance. For the 2 minute rule I need to almost do the opposite of getting myself to do them, and if they aren't important and they are going to take longer than 2 minutes, to  not do them. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?
