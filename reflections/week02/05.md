# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

I think this week went pretty well. I didn't really struggle with any of the concepts we were taught, and definitly am more confortable with JavaScript that with html and css. Most of the projects were pretty similar and as long as you understood arrays, objects, loops , and the premade arrow functions, things were farily simple. 

I definitly still struggle with time allocation. It still feels like you can either made a daily project look good, or have it functional. I hate picking between the 2.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
