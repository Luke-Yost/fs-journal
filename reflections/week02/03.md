## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main ways for writing messages to the console and consoleLogs and consoleErrors. You can use them to to show all sorts of data at different points as it is being effected my functions/ your code and you can also use them at different points to know where things are going wrong by just seeing what logs/errors make it to the console. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab lets you look at your live html and css and manipulate it live and be able to watch as the changes you've made come into effect. You can also diretly see the box model of any element that you click on and see it color coded for each of the 4 parts. The other super useful thing you can see in the elements tab is how you content looks on Mobile and how it will look as the screen size grows and shrinks in a  dynamic way.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can use the Sources tab to add breakpoint to you code to help find where things are falling apart. You can also just use the javaScript debugging pane to do that as well. Then you can go through parts of your code step by step and see what values are going into and out of each step of code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment 

I got distracted and spent way too long working on making the website look decent. I used coolers to create a cool color pallet and then did my best to make the layout of the website mimic a basic version of a real shop. I also spent lots of time really getting into making the the cards looking good. I am getting more and more used to bootstrap and the general group of classes to use to make things look good. Like rounding, shadow, border accents, border thickness, card, and others. I meant to spend time finishing up the website. Also just thinking ahead and using classed that will size for mobile and desktop on the first iteration and not coming through it to add mobile later on. I understand all of the JS stuff really well so far and am not too worried about that part.
