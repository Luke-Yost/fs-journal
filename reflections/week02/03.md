## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main ways for writing messages to the console and consoleLogs and consoleErrors. You can use them to to show all sorts of data at different points as it is being effected my functions/ your code and you can also use them at different points to know where things are going wrong by just seeing what logs/errors make it to the console. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab lets you look at your live html and css and manipulate it live and be able to watch as the changes you've made come into effect. You can also diretly see the box model of any element that you click on and see it color coded for each of the 4 parts. The other super useful thing you can see in the elements tab is how you content looks on Mobile and how it will look as the screen size grows and shrinks in a  dynamic way.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
