## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

By having a decent plan for all the tasks you will need to accomplish while working on a project, you can help yourself in several key ways. Having a rough idea of what you want your project to look like can help you set up a better bootstrap grid system that saves time in the future, makes work easier, and takes energy to format on mobile. In JavaScript, knowing what data you want to have in the project along with most of the functions you will need can has many of the same benefits. You can save time and energy, and you can group your code and variables in much more usable ways that are easier to read and use, take less lines to write, and require less refactoring down the line.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The biggest takeaway from this assignment was to always work on html templates that will be used in javaScript in html then comment them out. Also be very careful when copying the html over into javascript because with the formatting getting all wonky it can be very hard to notice errors, like leaving out a div from the original  html template. You can waste lots of time looking through your javascript for errors when the javascript is working just fine but the html inside of backtics has the error.
