## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

You can declare a function with the functions keyword. This hoists the function to the top of the code so it can be used before it has been called. There are also function expressions which are functions set equal to a variable. They are not hoisted and cannot be used before they are created. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
