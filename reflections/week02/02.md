## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

You can declare a function with the functions keyword. This hoists the function to the top of the code so it can be used before it has been called. There are also function expressions which are functions set equal to a variable. They are not hoisted and cannot be used before they are created. Lastly there are arrow function expressions which are pretty much just shorthand function expressions. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are the names in the () and are separated by commas. Arguments are the values that the parameters give to the function. Because arguments are nested inside parameters, they are often used synonymously.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher-order functions are functions that that another function as an argument or returns a function as a result. One that we have used a lot a lot in week 2 is the forEach loop.
