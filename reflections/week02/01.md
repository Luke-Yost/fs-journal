## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is where all a specific variable declaration( var let const) is able to be used and depending on which varible declaration is used, where the varibles value can be reassigned. Globally assigned variables are the same if they are declared inside or outside of a function. Let and Const are both block scoped.

2. What is Hoisting ?

It is how JavaScript moves functions and variables up to the top of their scope before running the code. If its a global variable, that takes in to the very start. If its a local variable, it takes it to the top of the function. Var variable are hoisted with a value of undefined while let and const arre not given andy value until they are read.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

You would use var in a scenario where you might want to redefine a variable later on in the code, and not just add too it. Let is generally better because can be treated as a entirely variable inside a function even if it has the same name as a global variable outside the function. It can also be updated and used within a function without worrying about repeated names effecting variables outside its block. Const can be used when you want fixed values that cannot be redifined or modified at any point in the code. The exeption being properties within a const declared object.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Especilly when I am really tired, I need to just take more frequent breaks. I spent more than an hour just trying to get my head around how I wanted to name the dict I had created and then the objects within them or just have one object with with 2 properties and scores just listed as a number after the name of the property as one of the two teams. Once I got past that brain fart it was pretty smooth sailing. But with more consistant breaks and or more sleep It would have taken signifigantly less time and the end product would have been better as well.
