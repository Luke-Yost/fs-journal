# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory? 

  I stayed on top of my workload pretty well this week. I did all of the readings and reflections before the day we were supposed to do then. I got through a decent amount of each daily project in the lab each day as well. I got at least ok sleep the whole week and I enjoyed this week more and was stressed less than most of the other weeks. The checkpoint has been ok so far. Ive definitely wasted a decent bit of time so far, but ive gotten a decent amount of it completed, and have a decent plan for the rest that I have to do. So far Vue has been pretty fun and I understand most of it pretty well, but as with almost everything we have done it just is kindof hazy in my mind from progressing so quickly and still retaining and using all the the previous content. I hope the upcoming weeks will help further solidify all the things I still feel hazy about.
