## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

It is very hard to pick because I really struggle with colors in a general life kinda way, let alone with this kind of color scheme creation. If I had to pick a few though, reducing the opacity of while text on a colored background to de-emphasize it would be one of them. Another would be using fewer borders, and instead adding other effects to create visual separation. Another great thing not listed would be just going to popular successful websites and using some of the general concepts that you see in their design in your own. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. 

Other than the cheating at design article already linked as the assigned reading, here are a few I found that caught my eye while reading them.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

You can create a pathway through a website that you want the users to follow subconsciously. You can also make certain actions, like purchasing a product or subscribing to an email list, more visually and mentally appealing to users. The inverse also applies. You can use colors to discourage actions and just where people want to look with color as well. So necessary content can exist on a site, but be very hard to find and see. A less manipulative way to use it is the prioritization of information. You can make it so a page has a good depth of knowledge, while also making it so that people can easily skim though and identify key concepts and information.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I had never used bootstrap before and the beginning was a bit rough but as soon and you understand the grid system it makes laying out websites so much easier. It is so much less of a struggle to get element where you want them on the page. In the previous afternoon assignment, I spent so much time, mostly unsuccesful, to just move elements into 2 vertically aligned sections within the main. Bootstraps grid system is a super logical way to use pre-made css to create exactly what you want. I will never look at websites the same after understanding how its grid system works. You see it almost everywhere.
