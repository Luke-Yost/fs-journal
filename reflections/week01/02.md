## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Psuedo classes are stylings that are only applied under conditions. Like Targeting the first specified element within another element. Or to change a text or background color based on some type on cursor event. I think some of the most commonly used psuedo classes will be ones that effect things tied to where the user is focused or should be focused. Like :focus or :hover.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the value of priority given to different stylings. It works to make it possible to have a system that can have some stylings have more importance, and override other styles. That way you dont have to write out styles individaully for every single part of HTML that you would like to effect.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

You could override lots if not all of other Styling and undo lots of other work you have done to style spacific parts of HTML. It could end up messing up much of your previous work, and even future work you do as well if you do not realize what what you are writing out is just being overrriden by !important

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Formatting html and css can be really difficult when trying to create your own css classes. Using pixels to move element around can seem easiest at first but is a pretty terrible option. It makes it so your webpage only looks right under very spacific circumstances, and will become a piece of "modern art" on mobile. I need to spend a lot more time getting familiar with making my classes and formatting flexible and using different ways to move content left, right, up, and down on the page that just using margin and padding pixel counts to move things around.
