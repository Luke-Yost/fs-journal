## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wire framing making it easier to start from nothing, and start defining the rough layout and features of a site. They are also easy to make and can be created in layers as they are needed. Upping the detail of the wire-frame mock ups as needed. This makes them resource and cost efficient. They are also very easy for people that are not familiar with web-design to be able to easily communicate their wants and expectations from the product you would be creating for them.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are usually 3 levels of wire-frames. Low, Mid, and High fidelity.

 Low-fidelity wire-frames are usually a black and white, rough layout of what the end website will look like. It is mostly just general shapes. No information is included that could distract from creating the outline of a product, and waste time. They usually can be drawn up with just pen and paper.

 Mid-fidelity wire-frames are a middle ground between what the final website might look like and the black and white first iteration. It starts to include shades of grey, placeholder image and text, and uses some sort of design software. 

 High-fidelity wire-frames use color and start to look pretty close to the end website/design. They might start to use specific images and have real text instead of filler. They are generally made pretty late in the design process and are created with tools like figma.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think the efficiency and usefulness of wire-frames really depends on the context. If you're making a clone website, they probably are not very useful. Or in situations where the majority of the details of the site are provided. That changes when you are starting with a blank canvas and when you are not sure what the end product should look like. Many of the details may also not be concrete. Then collaboratively working out the details of the product in different non-ridgid tiers that are inclusive to the people wanting the website seems incredibly useful and many times more resource efficient.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I learned a lot about how to use Github in collaboration with another person. All of my previous use of git had just been as a remote repository, and not as a version control system. I also learned that you shouldn't put images that you want to use directly into your file, you should just put the links to the images in files. Other wise git might freak out and decide that your push might take an hour in stead of a minute. I also briefly say how to merge a messed up tree with errors in orders of commits. I used figma to make a extremely basic box model mock up of the site Nik and I were trying to mock up. I also made a pretty terrible mock-up in Figma, but it was good practice and definitely got me more familiar with using the online software.
