## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

To make collaborative projects easier to work on. Instead of having people code not work with their teammates, git makes the integration as seamless as possible.

Also keeping track of different versions of a project as it develops over time and having the ability to revert to previous versions is a nessecity. Be it from errors in code, or changes in what the end product should be. Or to just see what progress was made during what time periods of development. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Different people can be working on different portion of a project without effecting one another. There can also be separate versions of code to be used for testing and will not be merged into the main branch until everything works properly. 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is the process that moves code to and from local repositories and to and from githubs online repository. It controls different branches of code and is responsible to merging them back together.

Github is the website that host and stores all of the  remote repositories. It is where you can go to download previous version of your pushed code and where you can view/download others public repositories and all their pushed versions of code.
